    "FizzBuzz is a class computer science interview problem. Create a script that completes the following tasks: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Prints numbers from 1 to 100, one number per row\n",
    "- If a number is divisible by 3, print \"Fizz\" (for example, \"3 = Fizz!\"\n",
    "- If a number is divisible by 5, print \"Buzz\"\n",
    "- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print \"FizzBuzz!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've figured out the basic FizzBuzz logic, turn it into a function that will work for any start and stop number. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to approach this problem, but here are a few things to keep in mind: \n",
    "\n",
    "- What function can you use to create a list of numbers within the range of 1 to 100? Is 100 included in that list? \n",
    "- What math operator can you use to tell if a number is divisible by something? \n",
    "- How can you use flow control (if, else) and operators (==, etc.) to deal with this problem? \n",
    "- What order should things happen in to ensure your program checks all the things it needs to, but does so efficiently? \n",
